Our-American-Cousins
====================

Project Abstract In this age of interconnectedness, it's easy to forget that we're a nation of different cultures and traditions. While it feels like we all eat at the same restaurants and watch the same TV shows, we sometimes need to be reminded of the differences that make us unique and our neighbors interesting. With “Our American Cousins", the user is presented with a map of the United States. He/she can click on any state and is offered a variety of facts, ranging from scholarly to whimsical: • Climate (average high and low temperature for summer and winter, rainfall) • Percentage of residents living under poverty line or in the top 1% • Percentage of residents making their living through farming • Dominant foreign culture (French for Louisiana, Dutch for Pennsylvania) • The way that barbecue is prepared (hot and spicy sauce vs. dry rub) • What a carbonated beverage is called ("soda", "pop" or "Coke") • Specialty item at McDonald's (e.g., Michael Jordan or Larry Bird McRib) This is just a sample of what can be provided on the website. The group will brainstorm together other things that can be added, with preference leaning towards the more esoteric.
